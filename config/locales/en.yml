        <p>
          The idea is a mental prototype of an object, phenomenon or principle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Creating the idea give it a name and the main direction/intention.
          For example idea "Car of the feature" can have the following intention:
        </p>
        <ul class="square-list">
          <li>Car of the future controlled by thought and intellectual system, which can find the shortest route</li>
          <li>A truck without a driver which can quickly and affordably deliver loads from point A to point B</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Noticed the difference? Then give a more detailed description of the idea (if you already have something to talk about ideas).
        </p>
        <p>
          Then specify the state of your idea and tags to help identify and classify similar ideas.

        <p>
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_%28computer_vision%29" target="_blank">Feature</a> is one of
          characteristic idea. Splitting the idea on the features allows you to better understand:
        </p>
        <ul class="square-list">
          <li>which components contains idea</li>
          <li>which properties/abilities idea has</li>
          <li>which resources need to implementation</li>
          <li>that can come from it in the end</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Use "weight" field you can specify features important for implementation.
          The most important features has great weight (maximum value is 1000).
          Negative value (from -1000 to 0) indicates that the feature is optional and probably never will be implemented.
        </p>
        <p>For example the idea &laquo;Car of the feature&raquo; can has the following features:</p>
        <ul class="square-list">
          <li>Four wheel. Weight 1000</li>
          <li>Electrical engine. Weight 990</li>
          <li>Luminous coating. Weight 100</li>
          <li>Integrated with iPhone. Weight -100</li>
          <li>AI for parking from the company &laquo;Microsoft&raquo;. Weight -1000</li>
        </ul>
